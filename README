This package is a GPL implementation of an iptables and netfilter module for
nDPI integration into the Linux kernel.

The prerequisites are:

- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Kernel 3.13.0-37-generic)
- Following packages to compile kernel-modules:
   linux-headers
   iptables-dev >= version 1.4.21-1ubuntu1
   nDPI source package ( updated to nDPI revision 9089, revision after that added patricia library breaks kernel compilation ).

-> Networking support
 -> Networking options
  -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)
   -> Core Netfilter Configuration
    -> Netfilter connection tracking support

- If your kernel version is 2.6.31 or greater, then you should DISABLE
  Netfilter conntrack for the Netlink protocol.

In kernel 2.6.34 or greater its defined as:

Connection tracking netlink interface
Symbol: NF_CT_NETLINK
Location:
-> Networking support
